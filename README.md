# üè™ Fantasy Market Simulator

‚úÖ This project is designed to showcase **engineering depth**, not just **entertainment value**.

Fantasy Market Simulator is a real-time business simulation platform built in Unreal Engine 5.5 using C++ and Blueprints.  
It simulates inventory management, dynamic pricing, AI task automation, and UI systems ‚Äî similar to real-world retail, logistics, or operations software.

---

## üéØ Project Goals

- üß† Showcase full-stack development using C++ and Blueprints
- üß© Demonstrate systems programming (AI, inventory, crafting, etc.)
- üß± Integrate purchased and modified marketplace assets to support rapid prototyping and system development
- üñºÔ∏è Support a clean pipeline for importing original or edited assets via Blender
- üß™ Optionally include testing/automation where appropriate
- üíº Serve as a compelling project for technical portfolios

---

## üîß Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Full-stack Unreal Engine development (Blueprint + C++)
- Time-based system updates using manager patterns
- Inventory system with drag-and-drop UI and DataTable-driven item definitions
- Dynamic pricing algorithm simulating supply/demand logic
- AI-controlled worker behavior using task queues
- Save/load persistence and state management
- Git-based version control with organized folder structure
- Asset integration pipeline (Blender ‚Üí Unreal with LODs and collision)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Engineering Focus Areas

This project emphasizes:

- Clean software architecture with modular components
- Real-world problem modeling (inventory, automation, pricing)
- Debugging complex real-time systems
- UI/UX design principles in an interactive environment
- Cross-discipline integration (code + art pipeline)

---

## üé® Asset Usage

This project uses a combination of:

- Purchased third-party assets (e.g., meshes, textures, sounds) to accelerate development and ensure consistent visual style
- Custom logic, systems, and tooling built in C++ and Blueprints
- Original assets (planned for later phases) created or modified in Blender and imported through a structured pipeline

Asset packs are used strategically to:

- Accelerate prototyping of gameplay systems
- Maintain focus on simulation and engineering depth
- Minimize art workload without sacrificing quality

All third-party assets are fully licensed and will be clearly credited in the documentation and/or game credits.

## üéØ Career Relevance

This project serves as a portfolio piece for roles such as:

- Software Developer / Software Engineer (generalist)
- Simulation or Systems Engineer
- Technical Designer or Tools Programmer
- UI/UX Developer (interactive software)
- Full-Stack Game Developer

---

## üìà Business Simulation Value

Though presented in a fantasy theme, the systems in this project simulate real-world business workflows:

- Inventory logistics and stocking behavior
- Automated worker task scheduling
- Time-driven revenue cycles
- Dynamic market pricing
- Storefront UI modeling customer interactions

These same patterns are applicable to retail software, training simulations, or logistics platforms.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

> These will be updated once Phase 0 is complete.

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `.uproject` file in **Unreal Engine 5.5+**
3. Open the project in **any compatible C++ IDE** (e.g., Rider, Visual Studio)
4. Press **Play** inside the Unreal Editor to run the simulation

‚ö†Ô∏è This project currently runs only in the Unreal Editor. A playable build will be released in a later phase.
